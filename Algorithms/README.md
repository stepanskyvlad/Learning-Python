# Understanding Algorithm Performance
- Measure how an algorithm responds to dataset size
- Big-O notation
  - Classifies performance as the input size grows
  - "O" indicates the order of operation: time scale to perform an operation
- Many algorithms and data structures have more than one Big O
  - Inserting data, searching for data, deleting data, etc.
##### Common Big-O Terms
