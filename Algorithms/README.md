# Understanding Algorithm Performance
- Measure how an algorithm responds to dataset size
- Big-O notation
  - Classifies performance as the input size grows
  - "O" indicates the order of operation: time scale to perform an operation
- Many algorithms and data structures have more than one Big O
  - Inserting data, searching for data, deleting data, etc.
##### Common Big-O Terms

# Sorting Data
## The Bubble Sort
- Very simple to understand and implement
- Performance: O(n^2)
  - For loops inside of for loops are usually n^2
- Other sorting algorithms are generally much better
- Not considered to be a practical solution
