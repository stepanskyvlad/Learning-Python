# Kata name: Persistent Bugger

# Write a function, persistence, that takes in a positive parameter num and returns its multiplicative persistence,
# which is the number of times you must multiply the digits in num until you reach a single digit.
# 999 --> 4 (because 9*9*9 = 729, 7*2*9 = 126, 1*2*6 = 12, and finally 1*2 = 2)
