# Objects
Mutable vs. Immutable:
- A mutable object can be modified after creation.
- Immutable objects are stuck in their creation state.

Mutable objects in Python:
list, dict, set

Immutable objects in Python:
string, tuple

In Python, the plus operator creates a new string containing the concatenated phrase, and binds the new object to the name of variable.
